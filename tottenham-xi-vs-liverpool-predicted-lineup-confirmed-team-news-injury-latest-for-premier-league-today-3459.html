Spurs are looking to bounce back after a damaging 3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest last weekend. The club has several key absentees, including Dominic Solanki (recurring ankle injury), Dejan Kuusela (patella injury) and James Madison (surgery after Europa League final). Spurs are hoping for a lineup without new signing Joao Palhinha due to a good mental state ahead of the visit of Liverpool. Frank de Boer has also mentioned that players like Archie Gray and Joao Palhinha would potentially be substituted due to their mental state, but has stated that both are in good place. Spurs have announced two changes from the previous lineup, with Yves Bissouma not available for the match due to being called up for the Africa Cup of Nations. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is set to host a Premier League match between Liverpool and Tottenham on Tuesday, 13 January at 8:00 pm (UK time). Injury updates will be updated throughout the match, along with any other news or team news.</div>
