Liverpool continued their gathering of momentum, a second straight win secured by goals from Alexander Isaak and Hugo Ekitike. The fact this did not resemble Liverpool's 6-3 rampage of 12 months ago may speak volumes for how both teams have developed. Arnés Slott would have been delighted to see the interval substitute Isaak open the scoring, only to see his glaomour signing sustain a nasty-looking injury in the process. Ekitike seemed to have put matters beyond doubt but Richards’ late drive, a note of pride for Spurs, was reminder of the champions' lingering frailties. Another sending-off, this time for Cristian Romero in added time, ramped up the dynamism as Spurs rarely fulfil their potential.</div>
