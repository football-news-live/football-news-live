Heading into their trip to St James' Park, Newcastle United had left their last four Premier League visits empty-handed. However, the club is now in a desperate need of points after overseeing a 2-0 win over Everton and recent comments from Enzo Marescabre have further muddied the waters in west London.

This week's match will see the Newcastle United travel to one of their recent bogey teams, Chelsea, hoping for a positive result to secure a place in the top half of the table. The game will kick off at 5 pm UK time and can be streamed live on Premier League's official website.

Expert Insight:

With injuries plaguing their squad, Newcastle is currently in the bottom half of the table. They have struggled to get a consistent flow from their performances, making them vulnerable against teams in their current situation. However, the recent win over Everton has given them hope and they will be eager to end their winless streak.

Meanwhile, Chelsea are struggling to regain form after losing four games on the bounce. The team is not only short of experienced players but also needs to focus on defending effectively in order to avoid conceding goals. However, this could prove to be an advantage for the hosts, who have a weakness in defense.

With key players injured or unavailable, Chelsea will most likely field their young and inexperienced squad in a bid to secure any result. The home team will rely on their own attacking prowess and defensive resilience to break down the hosts. It remains to be seen how the game will unfold but it's certain that the outcome won't go in favor of Chelsea.</div>
