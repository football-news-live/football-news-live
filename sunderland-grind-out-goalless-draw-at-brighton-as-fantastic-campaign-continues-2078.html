            <div class="content">"Sonderland grind out goalless draw at Brighton as fantastic campaign continues"

A battling goalless draw against Brighton was the highlight of a season-long winning streak for Sunderland, who maintained their impressive form with another impressive performance in front of 6,875 spectators at The Amex Stadium. Regis Le Bris' side made four changes from last weekend's 1-0 Wear-Tyne derby victory over Newcastle but still managed to secure a draw that kept their Africa Cup of Nations campaign alive, with two changes enforced following the defeat against Liverpool in the previous match. Sunderland's impressive start to the season continued as they survived an optimistic penalty attempt from Brighton midfielder Joeel Veltman, while goalkeeper Robin Roefs kept out a Matts Wieffe header and defender Enzo Le Fee cleared his own spot-kick. The Black Cat's impressive season has seen them collect 27 points from 17 games so far, with the match against Brighton providing an opportunity to build on their memorable Wear-Tyne derby win over Newcastle.</div>
