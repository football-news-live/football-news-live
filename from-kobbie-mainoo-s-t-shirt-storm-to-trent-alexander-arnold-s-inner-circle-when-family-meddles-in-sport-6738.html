            <div class="content">From Kobbie Mainoo's infamous T-Shirt storm to Treant Alexander-Arnoald's inner circle, family meddling is not uncommon in the world of football. This article takes a look at some of the most famous cases where families have involved themselves with players' careers.

1. Kobbie Mainoo's T-Shirt Storm: In 2017, Jordan Mainoo, Kobbie's brother, posted an Instagram post showing off his newly bought shirt featuring a slogan "Kobbie Made It" next to the Manchester United emblem. This caused quite a stir among the fanbase and even led to some fury from the main man himself, who later deleted the post.

2. Treant Alexander-Arnoald's Inner Circle: In 2019, 23-year-old Treant Alexander-Arnoald signed for German club Fortuna Düsseldorf. His parents were already based in the region and decided to fly out to watch the signing. Upon their arrival, they were told that they would have to pay €85 (£77) for a meal at the team hotel. When confronted by a local newspaper, Alexander-Arnoald's father explained that his family had come on holiday to watch the club play, and was unaware of the cost.

3. Jesse Lingard's Divorce: In 2018, Jesse Lingard married fellow footballer Yasmin Zayed-Jiwa. The couple later divorced after Lingard's wife, Josie, accused him of infidelity and child abuse.

4. Marcus Rashford's Daughter's Naming: In 2018, Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford named his daughter Jenson Grace Rashford. The naming of a baby girl in this context is not uncommon amongst families with children playing for elite clubs.

5. Paul Pogba's Grandmother Visiting: Last year, Paul Pogba's grandmother accompanied him to Manchester United's Champions League final win over Liverpool. This was not unusual as many family members attend games of the world's top teams.

These are just a few examples of how family meddling affects footballers' careers. It is clear that the lines between personal and professional relationships in the sport can be blurred, leading to both positive and negative outcomes for players.</div>
