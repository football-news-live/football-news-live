            <div class="content">Acting as a sports journalist, I am responsible for providing in-depth analysis and commentary on the latest football matches, including the significance of each game and the role that various players may play. In this context, Aston Villa's recent victory over Manchester United is a major test for Unai Emery's title-chasing side ahead of Christmas. With six consecutive victories to their credit, Villa are now in third place in the Premier League table with 6 points separating them from second-place Arsenal and fourth-placed Manchester City. However, the game against Manchester United has been marked by controversy surrounding midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who has not started a single league match for the club this season amid rumours of a possible January exit. Despite his lack of playing time, Mainoo’s brother, Jordan, wearing a T-shirt with the phrase “Free Kobbie Mainoo” at Old Trafford on Monday to mark Amori’s victory, has raised speculation that his relationship with Amorim is breaking down and that he may be free to leave. Despite this, Villa have won 41 Premier League games against Aston Villa with 18 coming away from the venue, meaning they remain a formidable opponent for any club in England's top division.</div>
