            <div class="content">Ladbrokes Championship club, Leeds United, has opened a six-point gap on their relegation zone with a dramatic victory against Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Mark Viduka became the first player to score in five consecutive games during a five-game stretch in 2003 for Everton, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin doubled the score to secure his side's top-flight status with his instinctive finishing in the 79th minute. The former Everton striker couldn't have imagined almost four months ago when he was without a club and had barely played since a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, managing to convince Leeds to sign him as their new No.9. Palace spent the first half trying to dictate the tempo but were eventually overrun in the second, with Calvert-Lewin scoring three of their six goals to increase his season tally to five. The game featured ten changes from their recent draw against Kuwaiti side KuPS and there were more than 12 alterations before half-time, but Palace couldn't find a way through the packed midfield or attacker, allowing Leeds to take control of the match in the second. After the break, the Eagles began to struggle and were fortunate not to concede further goals as Calvert-Lewin fired two into an empty net before adding another from the resulting corner. With Henderson spending the first half on the sidelines with a knee injury, Leeds manager Simon Grayson made several changes to try and find a way back into the game, but Palace held on for a 3-2 victory that saw them move away from danger in the table.</div>
