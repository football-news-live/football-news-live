            <div class="content">Sam Tabuteau learned three things from Tottenham's valiant but ultimately defeated display against Liverpool at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Firstly, Spurs need to learn from their recent man management issues, as Xavi Simon's red card just before half-time changed the complexion of the game. Secondly, it was a demonstration of character from the Tottenham support staff, as they rallied behind their players after losing what would have been a crucial goal with ten minutes to play. Thirdly, Tottenham should not be afraid to face criticism over their underperformance and lacklustre form in the Premier League this season. Despite the defeat, there were positive aspects to take away from the game, such as Spurs' impressive work-rate and determination, which could bode well for the remaining games of the campaign.</div>
