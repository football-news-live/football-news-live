            <div class="content">In response to this story, the Football Association has announced that Chelsea will be subjected to a £50,000 fine after a second cautioning for fouling during their match against Newcastle. The team picked up seven yellow cards in total, including six players and manager Enzo Marescapicked up six cards. This is the first time that any team has been fined twice under this FA rule, which imposes a £25,000 fine for accumulating six or more yellow cards in one match. It is not the first time Chelsea has been called into question by the league, having been docked four red cards earlier this season, including an initial two-match touchline ban following their win over Liverpool. Marescaca was subsequently given a one-match touchline ban for enjoying wild celebrations at the end of the match against Liverpool earlier in the season.</div>
