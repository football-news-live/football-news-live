            <div class="content">Acting as a Sports Journalist, I have witnessed the live action of Everton vs Arsenal in the Premier League. After being frustrated for 20 minutes, the Gunters broke through on goal and scored a golden chance to break the deadlock. Viktor Gyokeres stepped up to convert the penalty, putting the Gunters ahead and securing top spot in the league after Manchester City's win over West Ham earlier in the day. The live blog below is updated with the latest action:

(58 minutes): Alcazar flashed a volley wide with a full-length shot from the edge of the box, but there's a penalty check being done for Everton. Saliba and Barry both go for the ball, but Arsenal's strike keeper's foot is seen to be on the goalkeeper's hand, leading to strong appeals from Arsenal. The freak event has been cleared, but you see those given. Gyokeres goes into the book for delaying the restart after a foul on Grealish. Everton 0-1 Arsenal (56 minutes): After a foul by Grealish on Saliba, it is confirmed that Gyokeres has been cautioned and is sent off. The crowd's loudness during half-time was notably higher after the penalty incident.</div>
