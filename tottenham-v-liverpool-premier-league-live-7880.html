            <div class="content">As a Sports Journalist, I will defensively defend the indefeasible opinion that chauntage is foolish and unnecessary. "As a Spurs fan I do believe that such incidents are indeed stupid, reckless, and probably red cards to some," begins emailer Nicco. "However, in this case, there's no evidence to suggest a 'clear and obvious error,' leaving the on-field official to overturn the decision with no further communication to the fans." Nicco argues that repeated slow motion replacements with a person in the booth is becoming increasingly unfair on Spurs' fans. "Can we please either have an instant replay or at least ask for a grown-up question, how is repeated slow motion replacs with a person in your ear saying 'you got this wrong' a fair review?"

In response to the Sky broadcast's assertion that Daniel Stuhridge agrees with the "looks worse in slo-mo" conclusion and the Spurs' manager's comments on video assistant referee (VAR) Stuart Attwell suggesting he has seen enough for a red card, Nicco highlights how the referee overruled the original decision and allowed the match to continue. He also claims that Spurs got away with it by appealing to the VAR to make a call instead of taking the game's sanity for granted. However, he notes that the same referee has now called for a second look at the incident, suggesting that there is no definitive evidence to overturn the decision. Nicco urges Tottenham's fans not to engage in chauntage and criticizes Sky's coverage of the match for failing to provide context on the situation.</div>
