            <div class="content">Acting as a Sports Journalist, rewrites this passage of Peter Lawwell's clueless club, CeltiC, losing their narrative and flailing bossows Wilfried Nancy out to dry. The context is given in the text. The article highlights how the former Bosnian international footballer, Salutations, was sent in by his followers to express his disappointment over the lack of new ideas from CeltiC manager, Peter Lawwell, during their latest game, and the manager himself admitting that he knew all there is to know about Scottish football. The passage also makes a comparison between Lawwell and former player Russell Martin who stated that Nancy's problems at Carlisle United made him leave his club.</div>
