Headline: Manchester City 'must prepare' for successor, says Guardiola.

Context: Manchester City 'must be prepared' to plan for his departure and eventual successor - but insists he is far from finished at the club.

It was reported in November 2024 that Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who previously worked as an assistant to Pep Guardiola, claimed speculation about a new managerial appointment was 100% speculation.

In January 2025, Guardiola signed a new contract which runs until the end of 2026-27. Speaking on Friday, he said: I'm happy here, I want to stay here. What can I say? Always results decide. When it is the [end of] chapter the club will choose the best one to continue this incredible period in Man City.

City endured an underwhelming 2024-25 campaign, in which they failed to win any major domestic silverware for the first time since 2016–17. However, this season has seen a summer rebuild, with Guardiola reportedly set to end his 38-year reign as manager at the end of the current campaign.

Guardiola will exit the 'moment he feels it is done' in the summer but will remain involved in his side's affairs until the end of 2026-27.

I'm excited because there is a margin to improve, to do it better. That is what I like, he said. Last season was a really, really tourch season and I didn't give up and I was there. This season is much better in terms of many things I'm seeing and still I'm here.

It depends on my feelings and my feeling right now is good. That's why I want to continue.
