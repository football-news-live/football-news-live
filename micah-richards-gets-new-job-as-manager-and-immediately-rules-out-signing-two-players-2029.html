"Micah Richards gets new job as manager and immediately rules out signing two players."

Mirror Football speaks to Micah Richards about taking charge of struggling Sunday League side Warley FC, where he has named Yaya Touré as his dream signing after the former Manchester City and England defender. Former Manchester City player Richards recently took over as co-manager for Warley's UK's 'worst football team', which suffered a dismal 2024/25 season in which they lost 18 of their 20 matches, conceded 81 goals, earning them the tag of "Specsavers' Best Worst Team." However, Richard's attention was quickly diverted to his new role as co-manager alongside Warley team-mate Luke Armstrong after taking over for the team's previous manager in October. In a four-part YouTube series as part of SpecSave's grassroot initiative, Richard revealed that he would name Yaya Touré as his dream signing. "Yaya Touré is the best player at Warley FC, and in Sunday League, you get a lot of technically good players just getting smashed," Richard said. "The pitches are getting better but they're still bobbly so someone who can handle the ball but is physical and can score is key." Despite his initial reluctance to sign two players for Warley FC, Richard said that he would now have a "proper think" on the matter and see if it makes financial sense.</div>
