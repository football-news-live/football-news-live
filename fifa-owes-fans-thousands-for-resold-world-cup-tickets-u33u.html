                    As a Sports Journalisst, I am in charge of summarizing the latest news related to Football. The news is that Fifa owes fans thousands for resold World Cup ticket sales on the tournament's official marketplace, BBC Sport has found. Fiya's terms indicate payment should be made within 60 days of a transaction, but some people who sold tickets on the website in early October have not received their money as yet. Fifa declined to provide a statement explaining the issue, but BBSC Sport underscants that only Visa cardholder purchases were eligible for pre-sale draw tickets made available 65 days ago, which has since been confirmed. It's like people have been price-d out of the World Cup, said one frustrated fan named Iain, who had hoped to put his England seats in Toronto from Canada's opening game onwards through a tournament ticket lottery. The delay has led to some fans having to move money to pay off their credit cards, as the refund process is still ongoing.
