                    Headline: Amoriom Feels 'Entitlement' at Man United as Players Show Criticism and Difficult Moments are Fuel to Prove Him Wrong

Context: Man United head coach Ruben Amiri is furious about the entitlement of his players, who have been criticized by fans after a difficult start to the season. This week, youngsters Harry Amaim and Chi Doe Obi posted online pictures highlighting their achievements, with some saying they would rather leave the club than continue with Maino. Amiri feels that this entitlement should not be allowed, as players should use criticism to improve their game and prove him wrong. He believes the players have a responsibility to the club, which he calls dangerous, and he is adamant about not letting them off the hook. This, according to Amiri, is the wrong approach. His thinking aligns with Roy Keane's philosophy, which suggests that difficult moments in life are necessary for growth, as shown by players like Maino.
