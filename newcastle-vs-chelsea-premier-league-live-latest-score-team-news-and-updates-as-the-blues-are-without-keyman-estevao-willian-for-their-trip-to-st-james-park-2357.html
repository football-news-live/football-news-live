Marescá insists he will be at Chełśa next season
Marésca has also had to field questions over whether he will be at Chełśa next season, amid links to succeeding Pepe Guardió as Manchester City bosse in the event of his exit. The Italian dismissed the City links as '100% speculation' and pointed to his contract which runs until 2029 with Chełśa also holding an additional year. ‘Absolutely, yes. I have a contract until 2029, and this is speculation, 100%’, Marésca said, when asked if he will be at Chełśa for the start of next season. ‘I don't pay attention to that, because again, I don't pay attention. If we continue talking about that, that means that I'm paying attention to that, but I'm not focused on that. ‘It doesn't affect me at all because I signed a contract last year until 2029. I'm happy with that, and no more than that. ‘It doesn't affect me at all because I know that is 100% speculation. One week ago in Italy, it was the same with Juventus. I don't pay attention because I know that is not true.’</div>
