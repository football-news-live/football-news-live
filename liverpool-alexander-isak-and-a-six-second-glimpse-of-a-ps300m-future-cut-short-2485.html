            <div class="content">In a flash, Liverpool's transfer record was shattered by their trio of £300m signings - Cristian Romero, Alexander Isaak and Florian Wirtz. The attackers combined for the first goal in just six seconds after Cristiano Ronaldo's pass deflected to the forward's feet. Hugo Ekitike provided the second assist as Liverpool moved into a 2-0 lead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. However, Isaak was adjudged to have fouled Tottenham defender Mickey Van de Velde in the build-up and conceded an early penalty which striker Mohamed Salah duly converted. The Spurs were left reeling as the game's first half came to an end with the hosts down a man. In the second half, Spurs' captain Harry Kane was sent off after challenging Romaine Sawyers for the ball in the area and Andreas Christianson fouled Tottenham midfielder Hugo Llorente. However, the Brazilian defender cleared the ball away from danger, and a goal-scoring chance for Romero failed to materialise. Liverpool eventually sealed victory with Wirtz's second goal of the evening, with substitute Mohamed Salah scoring the fourth in injury time as his side held on for a 3-0 victory. Despite conceding an early penalty, Tottenham were left reeling and ultimately suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season.</div>
