Why VAR took so long to award disputeed Newcastle goal against Chelsea? The Premier League has confirmed that "technical issues" with the semi-automatic offside system led to a lengthy VAR check before Newcastle's Nick Woltemade scored an own goal in their defeat to rival teams, but failed to push up in time as they attempted to award the goal. This prompted a request for the SAOT (Semi-Automated Offside Technology) to be used, which was not available during the VAR check. The semi-automatic offside system was down during this key moment of the game, leading to a long VAR check before the goal was finally awarded.</div>
