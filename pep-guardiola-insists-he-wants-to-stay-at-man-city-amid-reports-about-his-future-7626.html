            <div class="content">Sports Journalist: Pe's Guardio lai, who is currently in his 10th season at Manchester City and has been with the club for six Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League, insists he wants to stay at the club despite reports suggesting that their long-servicing manager could leave.

The journalist cites several reasons behind his optimism:

1. Results determine his future

2. He still has much to achieve

3. City's success in the last few seasons convinces him of a better decision-making process, and he wants to stay here due to the margin to improve and do it better

The journalist also mentions that Pe's feelings and motivation are clear: "He's not changing his mind about wanting to continue. He just wants to continue doing what he loves."</div>
