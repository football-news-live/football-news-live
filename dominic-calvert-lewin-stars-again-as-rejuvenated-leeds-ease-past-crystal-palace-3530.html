            <div class="content">In a thrilling Premier League match at Elland Road, Leeds United secured a 4-1 victory over Crystal Palace with two crucial goals from Dominiic Calvert-Lewin. The White Tigers led by a brace for the first time in six matches and improved to six wins in a row after five consecutive games without conceding. With Calvert-Lewin's second strike, they also extended their lead at the top of the Premier League relegation zone to eight points from the current 30th position.

With just three minutes on the clock, Calvert-Lewin opened the scoring with a fine finish after some great build-up play by Marcus Forss and Rodrigo Benitez. In the second half, Palace responded through Justin Devine's penalty that was saved by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford before Antony Stephen's rebound shot landed in the net to level things up. However, Calvert-Lewin struck twice in quick succession after the break to seal the win and give his side a crucial boost towards their survival hopes.

Inside the home crowd, there was relief as far as they were concerned, with Calvert-Lewin's brace hauling in a top-flip double for the first time since October 2020. He now has six goals in his last five Premier League games and seven overall for the season, which is a feat he managed for the first time in their latest UEFA Conference League game against KuPS.

On the field, Calvert-Lewin made an impressive debut for the team by scoring twice from the starting lineup, with the rest of his teammates also making crucial contributions to the win. The home fans were pleased to see them maintain their control and extend their lead at the top of the Premier League relegation zone.

In summary, this thrilling match between Leeds United and Crystal Palace resulted in a 4-1 victory for Leeds with two crucial goals from Calvert-Lewin, who extended his impressive run of scoring in five consecutive league matches to six games, and helped secure the top of the Premier League relegation zone as they improved on their previous 30th position.</div>
