            <div class="content">Sports Journalist Alan Shearer named Newcastle United defender Reecie James as the game-changer for Chelsea's 2-2 Premier League comeback draw at St. James' Park against Newcastle United in October 2021. In this piece, Shearer discusses how the free-kick scored by James in the 66th minute proved to be the deciding factor for Chelsea, as they gained a point following two goals from Nick Woltemade. Shearer points out that if Newcastle couldn't get close to Chelsea's wide players after James' goal, their wingers would not have started asking questions, leading to the team scoring first in this game. This highlights how James' free-kick was a significant goal-scoring feat and contributed significantly to Chelsea's eventual 2-2 draw.</div>
