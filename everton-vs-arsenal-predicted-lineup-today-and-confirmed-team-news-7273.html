Arsenal are still dealing with a number of injury issues ahead of their Premier League clash against Everton tonight. The Gunnerz welcome back William Saliba from ankle injuries, but Gabriel Magalhães remains out with a thigh problem while Ben White has limped off injured, joining Kaïdou Hadji Coulibaly in the treatment room after undergoing knee surgery.

For Everton, their squad is also under strain as Martin Zubimièdi has not returned to training due to a minor setback and Mikeł Artejà has eased concerns over his availability by serving a suspension.

Manager Mikel Arteta is expected to make changes to his starting XI, with Pepper Guardiola’s side hosting West Ham United in the Premier League at 3pm on Sunday afternoon. The likes of Arsenal's top options are Pierre-Hébert and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who are both expected to start in attacking positions. In midfield, Mikel Thomas will be looking to replace Folarin Balogun, while Cenk Tiersy has been recalled by the club after a spell on the sidelines with injury.

In goal, Emiliano Viviano will start for Everton, while Arsenal are expected to deploy their trusted No. 1, Bernd Leno. The other options include Aaron Ramsdale and David Luiz, who are also set to feature in defense along with Gabriel Martinelli. Defensive midfielder Lucas Digne could make his return to the starting lineup after serving a suspension.

The Arsenal vs Everton clash is scheduled for 8 pm tonight on BBC One and Sky Sports Main Event, with live coverage available via BBC iPlayer in the UK.</div>
