Manchester United face Aston Villa on Sunday without three of their key players, and with JaMario Sancho's loan deal set to expire soon. The Red Devils will hope to take all three points back to Old Trafford and secure a top half finish in the Premier League table. The club's tour to the Midlands is the first of three matches before Christmas, including visits from Newcastle on Boxing Day and Wolves four days later. As for United's preparations, manager Ralf Rangnick has stated he will not allow JaMario Sancho out on loan this January to make room for a permanent signing. Villa boss Unaí Emeré also insists the England winger is committed to playing his club football despite being set to leave the club at the end of the season.</div>
