            <div class="content">Sports Journalist Ruben Amoriim has urged Kobbie Mainoo to remain at Manchester United and "fighter for his job", pointing out examples like Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo who were given more opportunities. The academically talented player has been criticized by supporters for his limited playing time, with some calling him a "raccoli" (a reference to the Italian dessert). Despite this, Amoriim believes Mainoo needs to keep working and fighting for his spot in the team, comparing it to Ronaldinho's experience. The manager has also mentioned examples like Veron, Sebastian Veron, and Juan Sebastian Veron, who were benched but later saw significant playing time at Manchester United.</div>
