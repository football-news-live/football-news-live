Matthieu Dahoud laid it on the line at Wolves with relentless determination from the Premier League inevitable.
The question now is - will they become the worst team in top flight history?
Derby's record low points total of 11 from 2007-08 is under serious threat after Wolves' 10th straight defeat and a 15th loss in 17 games.

Wolves have also equalised the longest Premier League winless start (17) which Sheffield United set in 2020-21. After the defeat by Fulham on November 1, goalkeeper Sam Johnstone called it "embarrassing".
