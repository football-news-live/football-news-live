            <div class="content">In a fixture which said everything to the high standards that Sunderland have set this season, Brighton's December continues to drag on as they made the long journey south and dominated their hosts in a match where neither side could claim victory. The Black Cat's were only two points off third place heading into December, but had managed to pick up just two points from their last four games. Brighton bosse Fabian Hurzeler said it was not a surprise that Sundarland are where they are in the table, saying they have to "realize" that there are big opportunities to win the game. However, the match was not great to watch and featured enough chaotic moments to earn a victory, despite Brighton's attempts to claw their way back into the game. Overall, while the season still has long to run, there is no sign of a turnaround for Brighton.</div>
