            <div class="content">Jadoon Sancho's seasonal loan at Ashton Villa has been criticized by Villa boss Unai Emery as they aim to maximize his potential during the remainder of the campaign. Sancho, on loan from Manchester United, had yet to feature in the Premier League since arriving at the club, but has featured twice in Europa League matches, notching an assist against Arsenal a fortnight ago. With the January transfer window looming, Emery made his position clear during pre-Manchester United press conference, stating that Sancho needed help to recover his best performance. He also expressed confidence in him and believes he has a chance to perform at Ashton Villa with the club set to finish December and start January soon. With a winning streak in their recent matches, the Villa side is set to face United on Sunday.</div>
