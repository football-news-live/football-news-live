            <div class="content">Acting as a sports journalism reporter, the following is my revised version of the article titled "Frank Lampard issues apology after sparking post-match melée with sarcastic gesture to Southampton fans calling him a 's*** Steven Gerrard'."

In response to sparking a huge post-match melée at the end of his Coventry side's draw at Southampton, Frank Lampard issued an apology on Sunday evening. The Chelsea legend was criticized by a raucous crowd inside St Mary's, who referred to him as "a s*** Steven Gerrard" during the match.

During the game, Lampard, the Chelsea star, took offense at his teammates and supporters shouting at him throughout the match. However, he later received a sarcastic thumbs-up gesture in the direction of the Southampton fans, who continued taunting him even after he was taken to the pitch for dissent.

Despite this, Lampard left the field and walked down the tunnel towards the away support. The incident resulted in a large brawl between Coventry and Saint's players and staff during the post-match meeting.

In his heartfelt apology, Lampard admitted to the fans that he was upset and apologized for his language. He also clarified that he understands when fans say anything to him due to Southampton's recent behavior. The incident sparked a huge reaction from the fans and media, prompting the Coventry sports journalism team to issue an official apology on behalf of Lampard.

In conclusion, Frank Lampard is deeply regretful for his language towards the Southampton fans during the game and issued a heartfelt apology on Sunday evening. The incident resulted in a large brawl between the two clubs' supporters, but the sports journalism team apologized on behalf of Lampard to mitigate any damage caused by the outburst.</div>
