            <div class="content">Act as a Sports Journalist for Sports Illustrated. In context, Newcastle United was denied a stonewall penalty against Chelsea following Anthony Gordon's shoulder barge in the St James' Park turf during a chaotic challenge with Magpie defender Andy Madley. The VAR official's initial review deemed the aggressive shoulder-to-shield action to be a side-to-side contact, but Newcastle coach Eddie Howe argued that it was shielding action and not a legal stonewall attempt. The decision of VAR to overturn the official's call and rule against Newcastle was met with controversy and outrage from supporters, who believed that a penalty should have been awarded to the Magpies based on the video evidence. Despite this, both sides were unable to extend their lead after Reece James' free kick went wide of goal, while Chelsea were able to pull one back with Joao Pedro's second goal in as many games following a pressure build-up.</div>
