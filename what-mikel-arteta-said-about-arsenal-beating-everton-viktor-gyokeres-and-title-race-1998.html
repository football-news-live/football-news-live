            <div class="content">In his post-match press conference after Arsenal secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Everton on Satuday night, Mikel Arteca expressed immense satisfaction with the result and reclaimed their position at the top of the Premier League table. The match against Everton was described as a high-pressure contest against a very well-organised opponent, but Arsenal managed to maintain control throughout the game and prevent the game from becoming chaotic under intense stress. Summer signing Viktor Gyokeres showed leadership by taking a penalty that he decided for himself to take after a challenging situation with Bukayo Sakai and Martin Odegaard. Captain Odegaard's performance improved significantly during the second half, demonstrating his increased vertical passing ability, which helped the team find crucial spaces in the attack and create more opportunities to score a second goal. Arteca acknowledged some frustration that Arsenal could have scored more goals but was confident in their consistent level of performance in difficult away grounds and high-pressure moments. In conclusion, the manager's assessment of the match emphasised his team's ability to navigate several difficult away grounds and high-pressure moments recently, while highlighting how Odegaard's increased vertical passing abilities played a crucial role in the team's win against Everton.</div>
