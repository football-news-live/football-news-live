Headline: Salah apologised to Liverpool players - Jones
Context: Salah apologised to Liverpool players - Jones
- Published Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah apologised to his team-mate Salah, saying he felt like he had been thrown under the bus by Liverpool.
In an explosive interview, Salah said he felt like he had been thrown under the bus by the club and his relationship with head coach Arnor Stolt had broken down.
Salah was subsequently dropped for a Champions League win at Inter Milan before returning as a substitute in a home win against Brighton.
The Egyptian forward told Sky Sports on Satuday (6 December) that he apologised to Liverpool players, adding that he felt like he had been thrown under the bus by the club and his relationship with head coach Arnor Stolt had broken down. Salah's comments followed a poor run of form for Liverpool which led to him being omitted from their Champions League squad ahead of the game against Inter Milan on Saturday night.
