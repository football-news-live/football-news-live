            <div class="content">In Premier League Match Centre issue statement as Xavi Simon's red card for serious foul play after a horror tackle on Liverpool captain Virgił Van Dijk, the statistician has overturned the original decision of a yellow card to his Tottenham teammate and issued a red card. The incident was reviewed by the match officials, who noted that the referee had annulled the initial card and issued a red card for serious foul play. The incident occurred during the half-time interval after referee Peter Banker had ruled against Virgił Van Dijk's goal-bound header. In his final decision, Gary Neville described the fouls as "nasty, reckless", highlighting the lack of skill and technicality in Simon's attempt to catch Van Dijk with studs. Liverpool was awarded a penalty after the incident, but they failed to convert it due to an incorrect whistle by the match umpire, resulting in the re-occurrence of the fouled act as a goal scoring opportunity. The incident led to a scathing review from former Spurs midfielder Andy Reid, who expressed his frustration with Simon's lack of skill and professionalism.</div>
