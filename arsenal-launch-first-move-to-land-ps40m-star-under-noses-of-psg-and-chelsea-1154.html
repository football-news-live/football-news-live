            <div class="content">As per reports in French media, Arsenal are ready to make a move for midfielder Andrea Berta's protégé Ayyoub Bouaddi. The north London side have already made contact with the Gunnerz president and chief executive, and they are expected to table an initial offer of around £40m (approx. $52m) for the 18-year-old French Under-21 international. According to reports from France, Arsenal are the front runners in the race to sign Bouaddi, ahead of PSG and Manchester City in the chase for his signature. Despite the Gunnerz's attempts to secure a transfer, they have extended their midfielder's contract until 2029, indicating that they may be willing to pay €45m (approx. $43.8m) or more. Arsenal's interest in Bouaddi has come at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool are also closely monitoring the situation.</div>
