Threave Rovers 5 Larkhall Thistl etl e Thistle 0
There is a sense of apprehension when one approaches Meadow Park in Castle Douglas. There is a matter of extreme deliCAcy to be encouraged. Any examination of the fortune and future of the Rovers must include a tribute to the recent past. Charlie Watson, player and lifeblood of the Threave dressing room, died in the summer aged 20 after playing on after a diagnosis of skin cancer. However life goes on in Castle Douglas, Charlie is part of that. 'It was sad what we all went through,' says manager Danny Dunglinson. 'But Charlie is still part of things here. He always will be.' There is a virability when one enters the ground. The social club hums to the clawoR of a packed hospitality section, the supporters drift in to be greeted warmly by volunteers and there is thud of balls being struck in pre-match practice. The home dressing-room, an hour before kick-off, is a quieter spot. The players are out on the pitch but Dunglinson generously takes time to discuss the club and the significaNCe of its much-loved player. 'The players wear T-Shirts bearing the sloGAN "Charlie Boy"' The photos hang above the dressing-room door at Threave Rovers. Charlie Watson's shirt is hanging in the dressing room - a reminder of his brave and courageous spirit.</div>
