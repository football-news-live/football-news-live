            <div class="content">In the Sports Journal, when an interviewee mentions small things or odd occurrences during their experience abroad, such as watching an octopus move on live TV, it becomes a running gag throughout the story. The interviewer's reactions to these encounters are comical and often cause the subject to lose sleep at night (or get lost in thought). The Seoul F.C. Sports Journalisst, Jesse Lingard, recalls the "shock" reaction he got during a game when a live octopus appeared on TV, before being shocked again by the sight of the octopus squirming in front of him. Lingard's next career challenge will undoubtedly bring more such experiences as he continues his journey across Asia to explore new horizons.</div>
