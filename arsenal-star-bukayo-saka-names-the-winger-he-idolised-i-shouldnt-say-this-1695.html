            <div class="content">Sports Journalist and Arsenal Star Bukayo Sakayama Reveals He Didn't Like Comparing Himself to Legendary Forward

Ahead of Arsenal's upcoming game against Brighton, Sports Journalist and Arsenal Star Bukayo Sakayama revealed he didn't like comparing himself to the world's best wing-back. He admitted there's a legendary forward who he idolized growing up.
Sakayama revealed that his favorite player as a child was Neymar, who had become a worldwide sensation during Barcelona's prime. Despite being a great player, Sakayama noted that he didn't see the player as someone similar to himself.
Sakayama believes that comparing oneself to others is unproductive and has no point of interest. Instead, he advocates for personal growth and individual success. He stated, "I don't like to compare myself to other players because they're always going to have the better experience."</div>
