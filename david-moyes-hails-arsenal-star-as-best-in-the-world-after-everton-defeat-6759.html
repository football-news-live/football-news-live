            <div class="content">"David Moyes hails Declan Rice as 'probably the best midfielder in the world' after Everton defeat." Context: David Moyes hailed Declan Ricci as "the best midfielder in the world" after Arsenal's 1-0 win over Everton on Saturday night. Ricci, meanwhile, delivered an impressive performance at the heart of Arsenal's midfield and Moyes, who managed the 26-year-old at West Ham, credited him with developing his former captain Tim Iroegbunaom. "I thought Tim was playing really well, he was up against probably the best midfielder in the world in some ways and he did a really good job," Moyes said. "He stuck to it, we wanted him to do a lot of other things, we wanted him to pass forward more, we wanted him to be a bit more creative in his play at times, but the other side of his game he did really well." Coinciding with his praise for Ricci, Moyes also highlighted the contributions of other Arsenal players. "Mikel Arteta was full of praise for Declan's performance as well," he said. "Unbelievable all-round play, his leadership on the pitch, the amount of balls that he regained, as well that allowed us to run. He's been incredibly consistent this year again, and yeah, what a massive player for us he is."</div>
