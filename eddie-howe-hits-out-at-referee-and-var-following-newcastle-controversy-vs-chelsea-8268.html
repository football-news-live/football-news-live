            <div class="content">Sports Journalisst Eddie Howe slams VAR following Newcastle controversy vs Chelsea
Newcastle let their two-goal lead slip at home against Chelsea on Saturday but Eddie Howe was convinced his side would have been awarded a penalty following a controversial decision. The Magpies' led to 2-2 thanks to strikes from Anthony Gordon and Joao Pedro, but Chelsea equalized in the second half. Neither VAR official or goal referee at Stockley Park thought Newcastle’s chance of a penalty was deserving of a spot-kick, prompting the Newcastle coach to question how consistently VAR applies this decision. Howe said: "I think the player has gone into Anthony aggressively, too aggressively, so I think it is a stonewall. The defenders' only look is Anthony, not the ball, and I think it’s too aggressive." Aske if there was a lack of consistency from VAR, Howe added: "I think the player has gone into Anthony aggressively, too aggressively, so I think it is a stonewall. The defenders' only look is Anthony, not the ball, and I think it’s too aggressive."</div>
