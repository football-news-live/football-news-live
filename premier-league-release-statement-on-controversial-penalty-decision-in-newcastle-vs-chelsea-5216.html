            <div class="content">Premier League releaes statement on controversial penalty decision in Newcastle vs Chelsea has explained that the ball was "running quickly towards" the playing area and, with a "body check", Newcastle's Anthony Gordon was "completely wiped out" by defender Trevoh Chalobah. The VAR review ruled the non-call, with range legend Ross McCosist rejecting the idea that Chalobah shielded the ball from Gordon. Dejan Golobović, the Premier League's former goalkeeper, also disagreed with McCosist and said it was "100%" a penalty, while Sky Sports' Mike Dean agreed. The statement added that there was "no question of the correctness or interpretation of the decision", but rather how the player reacted to being challenged in the area.</div>
