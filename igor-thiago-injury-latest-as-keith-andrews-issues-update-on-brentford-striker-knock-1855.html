            <div class="content">The Brazilian forward Igor Thiago has picked up a knock during Brettford's Premier League match against Manchester City, leaving him out of action for the coming weekend's Carabao Cup quarter-final match against Wolves. Keith Andrews confirmed that Thiago and Jordan Henderson were missing due to "knuckles", but has not ruled out both facing Wolves at the weekend. The Brazilian forward was also absent from Brettford's 90 minutes against Wolverhampton Wanderers, though the club declined to confirm if he would be available for Saturday's match against their rivals. Meanwhile, midfielder Frank Onyeka has joined the Burkinabé national squad ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations starting on Sunday.</div>
