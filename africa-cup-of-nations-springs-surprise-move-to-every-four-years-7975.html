            <div class="content">As per the African Confederation of Football (CaF), the Africa Cup of Nations will be held every four years, following the proposal made by the Fifa president Gianni Infantino. This will bring in a more consistent revenue stream, which has been a long-standing issue for the tournament. Afcon 2028, scheduled to take place in Kenya, will go ahead as planned. The next Afcon will be held in Africa's capital country of Morocco (from 2027) and every four years thereafter. Additionally, a new annual African Nations League is being launched, which will fill the gap created by the Nations Cup, following the proposal made by Infantino to host it every four years. The tournament was initially proposed by CaF in order to ensure financial independence but had previously been held every two years due to club season schedules. This new structure aims to provide greater consistency and sustainability for the tournament, while also ensuring that clubs can release players during the summer break.</div>
