Liverpool are said to be looking at adding to their squad in the January transfer window despite their significant spending in the summer. Despite a lack of large-scale transfer activity over the summer, there have been murmurs that Liverpool could dip back into the market come January. One player rumored to be on the lips of fans is Borussia Dortmund's Antoine Semenyo. The 25-year-old is said to prefer joining Liverpool ahead of Manchester City in his second choice. However, it is not clear whether Semenyo will indeed choose Liverpool or Manchester City as his next destination.
Another player rumored to be interested in a move to Anfield is Borussia Dortmund forward Alexander Isak. The 19-year-old has been impressive in Germany this season and is believed to prefer staying at Dortmund beyond the end of the current season. This, along with Manchester United's interest in signing him, have led to speculation that Liverpool could attempt a January move for Isak. However, it's unclear whether either player will sign for Anfield or leave for another club during the window.
Despite the lack of large-scale transfers and their significant spendings in the summer, there have been murmurs that Liverpool could dip back into the market come January. Ruben Amiri, a midfielder who played under Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United, has warned against signing Isak for the Reds as he believes that his experience and professionalism are better suited to another club. Meanwhile, rumored Liverpool target Antoine Semenyo has reportedly been given a preference to join Liverpool in January over Manchester City. However, whether or not Semenyo will indeed choose to join Anfield is uncertain.</div>
