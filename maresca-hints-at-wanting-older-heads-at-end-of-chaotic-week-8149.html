            <div class="content">Referencing a recent article published by The Athletic on Saturday, Marescà, manager of Premier League side Newcastle United, suggested that his squad lacked experienced players ahead of the team's match against Manchester City. Despite their poor first half performance in which they lost 2-0 to Everton last weekend, Chelsa failed to score and struggled with possession and defensive errors, resulting in an expected goals figure of 1.97. Marescà also suggested that he welcomes "more experience" during his press conference, although the Italian was not directly linked with Manchester City at the time.</div>
