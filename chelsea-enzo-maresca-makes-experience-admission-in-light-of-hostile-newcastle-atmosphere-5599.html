            <div class="content">Enzo Marescá, head coach of Chelsa, admitted that having a youthful squad would make them more vulnerable at hostile Newcastle atmospheres. "If we had more experienced players in the team, it's natural that they can manage this kind of noise or situation better," he told TNT Sports. However, Marescá also noted that his squad's recent success in the Premier League may have helped mitigate this issue. Despite losing four consecutive matches at Newcastle, Chelsea managed to secure a 2-0 victory over Manchester City earlier this month. The Blues had only lost three of their previous 14 away games at St James' Park since 2021, with Manchester City also having suffered such a defeat in that period.</div>
