            <div class="content">As a Sports Journalisst, I am assigned the task of writing about Arsenal's pursuit of Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Ramaj on loan from Heidenheim. The German was impressive on loan at Heidenheim this season and the Premier League leaders are said to be seriously considering signing him permanently. Ahead of the new campaign, reports in Germany have suggested that Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Ramaj play for Heidenheim. As per SPORT BILD's Head of Football Christian Falk, Ramaj is one of several options on their shortlist, including David Raya, who has played alongside the goalkeeper during his loan spell at Arsenal.</div>
