            <div class="content">Acting as a Sports Journalist for The Newcastle Chronicle, I was covering the match between Newcastle United and Charlton Athletic on the evening of September 27th. With only three minutes gone, Newcastle striker Joelinton found the back of the net to score his second goal in the Premier League, making it two-nil for the visitors after just four minutes. However, as the ball was being passed forward by Newcastle's midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, Charlton's goalkeeper Joe Lumsdon stopped it with a header from Wolves defender Andy Robertson's cross.

During VAR review, both VAR technicians attempted to work out if the goal should be awarded but they were unable to do so. This led to a lengthy stoppage as VAR attempted to work out if the second goal had been scored correctly. The final decision was eventually made by former Charlton player Lewis Hall, who scored an own goal against his side's opponents.

During the match, Newcastle striker Joelinton became the fourth player to score twice within the first 20 minutes of a Premier League game against Charlton Athletic per Opta data. However, they did follow in the footsteps of Robbie Fowler for Liverpool (November 1994), Paul Scholes for Manchester United (October 1995), and Sergio Aguero for Manchester City (September 2019).</div>
