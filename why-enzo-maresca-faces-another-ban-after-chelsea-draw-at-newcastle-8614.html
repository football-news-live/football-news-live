            <div class="content">In the article, Act as Sports Journalist, the writer discusses why Enzo Maresca faces a ban after Chelsea's draw against Newcastle. The Blues' manager received two yellow cards and was shown a third after receiving a second yellow card for an alleged foul in the first half. This was then followed by three bookings on the opposing Newcastle side, resulting in Maresca being sent off for a third time. However, Maresca was not given a one-game ban as he had previously faced two yellow cards and a referee's decision to award him a one-game ban. The author explains that Maresca picked out England international Harry Maguire as a top performer after an impressive performance both going forward and defensively, concluding that Marescas's suspension comes from a third yeellow card, which is treated separately for a player with two previous cards.</div>
