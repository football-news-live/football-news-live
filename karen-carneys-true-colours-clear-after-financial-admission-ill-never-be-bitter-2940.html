The ex-England star is competing in Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing final and previously opened up about not making much money during her football career, despite missing out on the recent international success of the Lionesses.
Karen Carney insists that her modesst earnings during her football career don't bother her, despite missing out on the recent international success of the Lionesses. The ex-Arsenal midfield player is currently showing off her dance moves on Strictly Come Dancing and is set to compete for the Glitterball trophy in Saturday's final.
Prior to transitioning into football commentary, Carney had a lengthy career playing for both club and country. She earned 144 caps for England, scoring 33 goals and reaching third place at the 2015 Women's World Cup.
While she won three Cyprus Cups and one SheBelieves trophy with the Lionesses, most of her silverware came from her club career. With three league titles at Arsenal and numerous domestic cup victories in North London and at Chelsea, Carney had an impressive resume.
However, financial rewards didn't come as readily as silverware did. Despite this, Karen Carney harbors no resentment about not becoming a rich retired footballer. In a 2019 interview with The Times, the now 38-year-old expressed satisfaction with her career achievements.
"I never had any expectation to be successful financially," she said. "When I was 11, I just wanted to play for England. I didn't know when it would happen, how it would happen. I picked that dream and I want that dream. I'm who I am. I'm from Birmingham. My mom works at a fire station. My dad is a firefighter. We keep it real. We know who we are. I haven't made a lot of money but I'm equally comfortable."</div>
