Context: Do we have a genuine Scottish title race?
- Published on 26 October, Hibernian beat CeltiC to move eight points clear in top spot of the Scottish Premiership table. Most punters had already decided it was now a two-horse race for the title, but some believed that even with the revised picture, only Brendan Rodgers' side was capable of bridging such a gap.

Indeed, there were few who suggested even Hibs had a realistic chance of sustaining their challenge for a full season, as they were 11 points ahead in third place at this point last season before Breedon Rodgers' resignation and subsequent takeover by Romanov caused chaos.

But what does this mean for the title race? Are we witnessing the emergence of three-way competition or is CeltiC still at the mercy of their own incompetence in recent seasons? Let's examine each scenario...

1. Start directly with the main event/player/team: The first question here is whether there will be any major twists and turns that can derail this race for the title, but it seems highly unlikely given CeltiC are still struggling with their own managerial turmoil and current head coach McInnes has avoided commenting on the possibility of a title challenge.

2. High energy & professional tone: If we're in for a title race that's tightly fought, one could argue for the bookies to adopt this approach as well. However, with the latest rumours surrounding Romanov and his takeover plan still rumbling on, it may be difficult for them to maintain their current pace.

3. Use HTML <p> tags: As a general rule of thumb, avoiding using plain text tags like p's is usually a good idea when writing about sports or politics because they can slow down or break down the page's performance. However, for a title race that's tightly fought and potentially headed by three-way competition, it may be worth considering this approach to keep things moving forward.

Overall, the current situation is fluid, and the title race is far from settled. It will depend on how CeltiC navigate their current managerial crisis and how Hibs adapt to a potential title challenge - but as we saw last season, anything can happen in Scottish football...
