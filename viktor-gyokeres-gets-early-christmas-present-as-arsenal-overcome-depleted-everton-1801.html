            <div class="content">As Arsenal's manager, Mikel Arteta was awarded the Christmas No 1 spot for leading his team to victory over Everton on December 24th. With this accomplishment, he managed to stay atop of the Premier League table for six years. Even though they were demoted in May and their immediate response was winning three away league games, Arteta felt that it was more about practice than a test in theory since his previous three away games resulted in losses. He attributed his team's recent successes to opponents and colleagues alike, who helped him with generous acts like conceding two penalties and allowing the second act of generosity for a goal to be taken. While Gyokeres scored one goal and converted only two spot kicks this season, Arteta has taken 19 penalties in league matches since joining Sporting CP, making him the regular for his team's attempts on penalty.</div>
