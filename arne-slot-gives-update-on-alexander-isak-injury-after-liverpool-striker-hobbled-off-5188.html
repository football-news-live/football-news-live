Liverpool midfielder Alexander Isaak was forced off during their win over Tottenham Hotspur due to a leg injury, with the Sweden international receiving treatment. However, coach Jurgen Klopp was not willing to rule out the striker's involvement in the game and stated that he would need further assessment before determining his availability for the next match against Brighton on Wednesday. Liverpool will have to wait until their final week of the season to find out if Isaak is fit to play, with midfielder Richarlsrson likely to replace him in the starting lineup.</div>
