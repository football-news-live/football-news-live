            <div class="content">Sports Journalist Mikel Arteta has revealed what has given him "belief and confidence" that Arsenal can win the title after beating Everton 1-0 at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Despite being in second place at Christmas, the Gunners are undefeated since the start of the season, with their performance and consistency standing out from other teams in the Premier League. The journalist believes that what gives them belief and confidence is the team's consistency, which has been a constant feature throughout the season, including their recent win against West Ham United, who were previously top of the table after December. Arteta highlighted that this level of performance and consistency will be crucial if Arsenal is to challenge for the title in the upcoming months. The journalist's message echoes the sentiments of Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who believes that their positional play would have to get better if they are serious about winning a seventh title in ten seasons. Despite Guardiola warning his players about improving their play and becoming contenders for winning the title from now on, Arteta remains confident that Arsenal can still rise to the occasion and lift the trophy this season.</div>
