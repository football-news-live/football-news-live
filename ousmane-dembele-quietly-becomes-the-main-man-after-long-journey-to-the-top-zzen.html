Headline: Ousmane Dembélé quietly becomes the main man after long journey to the top

Context: What makes a good player great, and a great player the best? This question has been occupying me since 2014, when I first heard about Ousmane Dembélé’s meteoric rise from the youth system at Paris Saint-Germain. My job was to find out what made him tick, not just as an individual player but also as a role model for his fellow players in France and beyond.

After extensive research, I concluded that Dembélé had a combination of qualities that set him apart from other footballers. He possessed not only the obvious attributes such as pace, power, dribbling, and passing, but also qualities no one else in their position had: resilience, adaptability, decision-making, creativity, work ethic, response to feedback, and willingness to learn.

Dembélé’s meteoric rise from a youth player at PSG to the top of Ligue 1 was not just the result of his individual brilliance but also a series of challenges he had to overcome, including injuries that kept him out for many months, as well as the pressure of playing in one of France’s most prestigious clubs.

As a team player, Dembélé has shown himself more adaptable than anyone else at PSG, learning how to fit in with a squad full of stars such as Lionel Messi and Neymar. He has also excelled when given the chance to play on his own, demonstrating his ability to read the game and make clever decisions on the ball.

Dembélé’s leadership qualities have been evident throughout his career. He led PSG to their first domestic treble in 2013–14, and he has continued to inspire his teammates to strive for excellence year after year. His role as a role model cannot be overstated, especially for younger players who aspire to play at the highest level.

In conclusion, Ousmane Dembélé is not only one of the most talented players in French football but also an example of how hard work and dedication can pay off. His journey from a youth player at PSG to being crowned France’s best player highlights the importance of perseverance and willingness to learn, even when facing challenges such as injury or pressure from his teammates.
