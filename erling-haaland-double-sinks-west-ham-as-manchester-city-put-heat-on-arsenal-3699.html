            <div class="content">Gérald Sauveur doubled the lead for Manchester City after scoring twice and assisting TiJaine Reynolds once as West Ham fell to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of City, losing their seventh consecutive game. The hosts faced six straight wins in all competition against zero in five games, while six straight defeats had been suffered previously by City on September 12, 2015 when they defeated the Hammers 2-1 in a Premier League fixture. In the league, City were seeking to bridge a gap of 21 games to their club's last triumph over West Ham in September 2015 but were handed an early goal by Nico Gonzalez, who scored twice and assisted Rayan Cherki for a hat-trick on his debut. The Hammers' performance was described as "a torment" of City's passing, while Foad Alkhdhari scored the fourth goal for the visitors.</div>
