Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres is not up to it physically in the Premier League at the moment, according to Jamie Redknapp, after his August transfer to Arsenal. Gyokeres scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot to earn Arsenal three points away from Everton but Redknapp believes it has been a struggle for Gyokeres at the current time. "He did okay, it should’ve been better," Redknapp said on Sky Sports. "It's not the case because he’s found it hard up there, I think he’s struggling with the physicality of it. "Considering he's a very big guy, I very rarely see him win a duel one-on-one when I thought he could physically overpower people. "In terms of his touch, bringing people into play – not good enough. He needs confidence. Look, he's never going to be like a Bergkaamp who is going to bring the ball, roll people and play little clever passes, he's a battering ram who is going to score goals, make big moments and hopefully win you games."</div>
