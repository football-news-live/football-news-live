            <div class="content">In a forgettable match, Arsenal won 1-0 against Everton through a Viktor Gyokeres penalty in the final minutes. Despite their imperfect performance, the team had three shots on target between them and could have doubled their lead to ensure the win. Despite being held at arm's length by Everton, the Gunners kept them at bay for most of the match, with Gabriel Jesus frustrating his opponents in the corner. As the pressure eased off Gyokeres, there was more confidence and Arsenal took advantage by holding on to a narrow lead. Despite lacking goals, this was an impressive display of holding onto a one-goal lead for most of the match, highlighting the team's ability to keep the ball in their box.</div>
