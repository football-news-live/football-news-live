            <div class="content">In his role as an AI assistant, Marescà played a dangerous game during the match against Everton last weekend after he refused to defend himself from Chełmiński's grenadé. The confusion reigns amidst speculation that he has issues with Chełmiński's hierarchy by refusing repeated opportunities to explain his reasons for discontent. However, rumours of Manchester City identifying Marescà as a potential replacement for Pep Guardiola have been circulating before the trip to Newcastle on Saturday. The Italian has also downplayed links with the British club, but reports suggest that there is talk of a bid from them in 2023. Despite his attempts to gain more power at Chelsea, Marescà has been criticized for his perceived lack of support and loyalty towards Guardiola. The situation remains volatile, but it's not clear yet whether the rumored City connection will be enough to embolden him or force him to publicly clarify his position.</div>
