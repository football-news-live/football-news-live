            <div class="content">Enjoying their blend of Premier League form and top spot, Arsenal are set to face a stern test from Everton when the two sides clash at Goodison Park on Wednesday evening. After losing to Manchester City last weekend, Mikel Arteta’s side will be eager to get back to winning ways and secure their first win in 10 games. The pressure is on after falling to second-placed Leicester City, but the Gunner’s can still seal top spot with a victory over Everton. Despite being winless in their last five Premier League games against Arsenal, Everton are unbeaten in their last five against the Gunners, drawing two and losing three, which includes a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park in April. However, their current winless run will provide them with an extra motivation to secure points from Everton on Wednesday evening. Mikel Arteta’s first visit to former club's new stadium is also set to be his first visit, as Arsenal prepare for a challenging match against the Blues. Everton is familiar territory for Arteta, having spent six years at Goodison Park before moving to the Gunner's as a player in 2011. However, this will be their first visit to Everton’s new stadium, which they officially opened on December 19th, just three days before Arsenal’s match against West Ham United. The game is expected to see both teams looking for wins to secure top spot in the Premier League table.</div>
