Context: Newcastle United host Champions League (Group E) leaders, Chelsea, in a pre-Christmas cracker at St James' Park on Wednesday. The Magpies were defeated in their derby match against Sundarland last Sunday but received a much-needed boost with victory over Fulham in the Carabao Cup midweek. Chelsea also claimed victories over Cardiff City, which saw Newcastle rebounding to 4th place with an impressive victory over Everton this weekend. Metron's live matchday blog will bring you all the build-up, confirmed team news and starting XI updates throughout the game.
