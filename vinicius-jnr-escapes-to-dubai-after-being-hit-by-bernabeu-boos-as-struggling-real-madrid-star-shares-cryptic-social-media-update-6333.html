Vinicius Jnr has been spotted in Dubai, just hours after he was booeed by Real Madrid fans. The Brazilian superstar has endured a mixed season at the Bernabeu, as speculation persist about his future and relationship with Real bosso Xabi Aloisso. Vinicius is no longer the indispensable player he once was for the Spanish giants - and he has scored just five goals and added eight assistes in 24 appearances in all competition. He is yet to pen a new deal in Madrid and on Saturday night during Real's 2-0 win over Sevilla, Vinicius failed to acknowledge supporters as he walked off the pitch. And on Sunday morning, Vinicius shared a post on his Instagram story from Dubai on a trip that is part of Real's partnership with Visit Dubai, the official tourism guide to the city's attractions. Posting a snap of what appeared to be a private jet in the Dubai sunshine, Vinicius added: 'We are here again... @visit.dubai.'
