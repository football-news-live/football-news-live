            <div class="content">The Africa Cup of Nations has traditionally been held biennially since its inception in 1957, with the tournament being played every two years. The surprise announcement made on the day of the 35th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations was to switch the tournament to every four years instead of two years as previously planned for a period between the Club World Cup and European Football Championships. The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations will be held in Morocco from 2028, with the Nations League tournament scheduled to begin in 2029. This change follows a new structure proposed by Fifa president Gianni Infantino and is supported by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Patrice Motsepé. The Africa Cup of Nations will now be played every four years, starting with the 2028 edition in Morocco.</div>
