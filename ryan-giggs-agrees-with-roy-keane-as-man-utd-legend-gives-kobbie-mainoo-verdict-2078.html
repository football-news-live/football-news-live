            <div class="content">Act as a Sports Journalisst. Rui Costa agrees with Fernando Alonso as Fernando Alonso gives his verdict on the Ferrari driver's situation ahead of the Australian Grand Prix.
Rui Costa is confident that Fernando Alonso will be a factor in the Australian Grand Prix, stating that the reigning world champion has "proven himself." Despite being the defending race winner at the Albert Park circuit, Alonso has been plagued by reliability issues in recent races and has not yet secured pole position for the third consecutive event. Costa feels that if Alonso can maintain his current pace, he could challenge for victory. Costa stated that while he believes Alonso's chances may be limited, the veteran driver remains a formidable opponent to consider at the Australian Grand Prix.</div>
