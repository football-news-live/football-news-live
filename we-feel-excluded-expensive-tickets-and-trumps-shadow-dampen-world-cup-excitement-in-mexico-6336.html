Zamora, a Mexican football fan, does not remember how his father got tickets to the 1986 World Cup quarter-final between Argentina and England at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. But he does clearly remember the goals: first when Diego Maradona used his "hand of God" to push the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, then the "goal of the century", where the Argentinian went on a slaloam run, dribbling past half the England team before scoring.
When Zamora found out the World Cup would be returning to Mexico, he felt a swell of nostalgia and immediately knew he wanted to buy ticket... but was undeterred by the ticket price. Zamora has tried - and failed - to purchase seats online through Fifa's website, and realizes that it increasingly feels like "bad luck" on his part. The article is in HTML code.</div>
