            <div class="content">As an experienced sports journalism enthusiast with an expertise in live sport coverage, I am privileged to deliver this Sports Journalist live-blog from my vantage point at the 13th Premier League match between Aston Villa and Manchester United.

The match is scheduled for noon today (Monday) at Old Trafford Stadium, where both teams last faced off in September's fixture. The match will be available on live stream or TV coverage from BBC Sport and Sky Sports respectively. As the match progresses, I'll keep readers updated with the latest news, tactical setups, key players, and scores.

Aston Villa have been on an impressive run since a 0-0 draw at Leicester City last season, having won nine games in a row in all competitions (W8 D1 L2). Their next game against Manchester United will be their fifth encounter of the current campaign, where they won two, drew four, and lost twelve.

Manchester United have been on a downward trend since the 2019-20 season, with just two wins in their past seven games (D4 L3). The previous game between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Old Trafford Stadium was an absolute dud as both teams failed to create much of note.

In his managerial tenure so far, Villa's Unaï Emeré has won 55% of his games with the club, while Manchester United's own manager, Ralf Rangnick, has only managed a 39% success rate.

Aston Villa have an impressive young prospect in Morgan Rogers as their leading scorer with two goals so far this season. Meanwhile, Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo and Amadeo Mainoo were also suspended in the last game for an offence against another player.

United coach Ralf Rangnick has no clear preference when it comes to his strike force, opting for three different players in the previous encounter between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Old Trafford Stadium. Meanwhile, Villa will be without a suspended Casemiro and a returning Mainoo to replace their current option.
