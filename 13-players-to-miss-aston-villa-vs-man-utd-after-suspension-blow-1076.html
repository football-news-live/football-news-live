            <div class="content">Kicking off at 4:30 PM on Saturday, Aston Villa vs Manchester United will be missing 13 players across both teams due to injuries, suspensions, and international duty. The list includes Ruben Amiri's squad, who is set to miss a top-four spot with Liverpool and Chelsea in fourth and fifth place respectively.
Should the visitors maintain their scoring streak of eight goals in two matches, they will have to rely on goal-scoring stars such as Jack Grealish, Aston Villa's top scorer this season with 10 goals so far, and Adama Traore, who has contributed five goals to his team's cause.
Manchester United, meanwhile, will be looking to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester City after their two title rivals both won on Saturday, and the absence of some key players could affect them. The likes of Marcus Rashford (knee), Mason Greenwood (hamstring), Bruno Fernandes (thigh), Jadon Sancho (ankle), and Amadou Onana (calf) are all set to miss out on a chance to start at Villa Park.
On the other hand, Villa's unbeaten run in their last two matches is undoubtedly impressive considering they have only scored eight goals in their previous two games, while Manchester United's recent success against Arsenal and Manchester City should give them confidence heading into this fixture.</div>
