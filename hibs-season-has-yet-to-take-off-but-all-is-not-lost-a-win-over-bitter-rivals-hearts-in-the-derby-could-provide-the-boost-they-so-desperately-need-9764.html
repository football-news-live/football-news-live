            <div class="content">Much of the conversation before this scrapily low-quality 1-1 draw at Tannadice centrecame around Hibs' lack of statement wins this season. After another nine league outings that saw a seventh derby result in 18 matches, the fixture against Edinburgh Derby at Easter Road on Saturday is expected to be even more critical. Despite their disappointing campaign thus far, the team is currently fifth in the standings, ahead of Aberdeen's visit to CeltiC on Sunday. Head coach David Gray has a steady pair of hands at the helm and despite their thunderous charge to third spot last term, they still have work to do if they want to build on that platform. The break-up with Bill Folley and his Black Knight group in November just added to the sense that the firm sense of direction that existed not so long ago is going through a little bit of a wobble. Despite this, a home win over Hearts would provide renewed vigor for Hibs' season, and a share of the spoils could deliver festivals of cheer too.</div>
