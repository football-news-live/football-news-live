            <div class="content">Acting as an AI sports journalisist, I've crafted the following Newcastle vs Chelsea: Prediction, Kick-off Time, Team News, TV, Live Stream, H2H Results, Odds, Today. Here is the context:

Newcastle vs Chelsea kick off the Premier League weekend with a trip at north. The Blues have recovered from their four-game winless streak, but the last week has been clouded by comments from Enzo Marescà, who claims he has just endured his "worst 48 hours" at the club.

Despite this, Newcastle's recent form is nothing to be ashamed of, with four wins and a draw out of their last five games in all competitions. Meanwhile, Chelsea have lost their heads after losing their last two league matches to Wolves and Manchester City respectively.

Their last win was the 2-0 victory over Everton on November 19, and they will be hoping for a boost against the Blues, who are currently in the bottom half of the Premier League table.

With VAR being called into action, it's set to be a tense affair at St James' Park as Newcastle look to extend their unbeaten run against Chelsea.

The match kicks off at 3:00 PM local time and will be streamed live on Match of the Day on BBC One or Sky Sports Premier League, DStv Explora, GOtv Showtime and SuperSport Selects.</div>
