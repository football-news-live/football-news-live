            <div class="content">Acting as a Sports Journalisst, I rewrote this piece to highlight the forgotten Liverpool star Alexander Isaak's injury-plagued 2021 season and how it has led to fans being excited about Florian Wirtz, who could offer something new and unique to the Premier League. Despite just scoring his second Premier League goal since a £125m move from Newcastle in September 2021, Isaak fell victim to an upper-leg injury before being substituted in Liverpool's win over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium on October 6th. However, the club has stated that Isaak is "not expected to be out for too long" and may potentially return for the home match with Wolves in a week. The injury-plagued season has been a significant contrast to his impressive debut campaign, but the signing of Virat Kohli highlights how the Reds are looking to invest heavily in young talent rather than relying on established veterans. Isaak's performance against Tottenham demonstrated his potential as a versatile and creative player with the ball at his feet. As a picture speaks one thousand words, it goes: Unlucky Alexander Isaak finally shows signs of justifying his £125m price tag, forgotten Liverpool star who offers something new, and the signs that should get fans excited about Florian Wirtz.</div>
