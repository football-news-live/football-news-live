Headline: Under-fire Wolves exec steps down, replacing him with Nathan Shi.

Context: Under-fire Wolverhampton Wanderers executive chairman Jeff Shi has stepped down from his role after almost 10 years at Molineux, with the club currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League on just two points. In an unprecedented move, he will leave the position and be replaced by his son Nathan, who is a part of FoSU Sports Group since 2016.

Jeff Shi, who was in charge from 2008 to 2019, took over from former Wolves CEO Brian Gerrish after the club's relegation from the Premier League. Under his leadership, Wolves underwent a transformation into a global force, battling at the highest level and winning several major honors, including the FA Cup in 2018. However, the current campaign has been a disaster, with Wolves sitting at the bottom of the table after losing their latest match against Brentford on Saturday.

In his place, Nathan Shi will step in as executive chairman and chief executive officer for FoSU Sports Group, which also includes Nuno Espirito Santo as head coach. Jeff Shi had been a target for unhappy Wolves fans with his perceived lack of transparency and handling of the club's finances, leading to an outcry from the fanbase.

The move has not gone down well with many Wolverhampton supporters, who have called on the club to address their concerns through the appointment of a new executive chairman. The new management team will take over responsibility for the future of the club, including building a stronger future and reaching new heights. Despite this, Nathan Shi believes that together, as one pack, Wolves can move forward with belief, pride, and ambition.
