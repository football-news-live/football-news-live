Context: Newcastle left fuuming with officials as Chelsea complete thrilling comeback - 6 talking points
Newcastle left furious with the referees as their poor performance in their last game led to them losing to Chelsea at St James' Park on Saturday, October 23rd, 2019. Nick Woltemade scored a brilliant own goal within four minutes and Reecie James gave Chelsea a life line moments into the second half as they went on to draw 2-2 with Newcastle. Despite taking the lead against Sunderdland last weekend, Newcastle are still in 11th place, having let another victory slip through their fingers. Here are some talking points from St James' Park:
Nick Woltemade was certainly a villain of the piece last weekend as his own goal cost Newcastle against rival Sunderdland. But it only took him a few minutes to get back on track as he scored twice in quick succession against Chelsea.
Chelsa goalkeeper Robert Sanchez produced a brilliant stop to deny Anthony Gordon at the back post, but Woltemade made sure the ball was heading for the right net as he thumped it into the roof of the net after 15 minutes.
Newcastle's poor performance and refereeing decisions in their last game led to them losing to Chelsea at St James' Park on Saturday, October 23rd, 2019. This left them feeling furious with the referees and officials.</div>
