            <div class="content">Acting as a Sports Journalist for Tottenham Hotspur, Xavi Simon's sending Virgil van Dijk a red card message and apologising to his teammates and supporters after he was penalised during the match against Liverpool. In a post on social media, the midfielder took full responsibility and apologised to Van Dijk himself for the incident and said it would be a setback for him in the upcoming matches. The Red Card was given by VAR, which led to Spurs losing the game and Cristian Romero receiving a red card too. Simon's apology to the fans and teammates was clear-cut: "Mistakes happen, Virg is my captain. I would never intentionally hurt him or anyone," he wrote on Twitter.</div>
