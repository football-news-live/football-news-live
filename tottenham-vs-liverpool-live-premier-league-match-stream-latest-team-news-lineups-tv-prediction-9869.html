            <div class="content">As a Sports Journalisst, re-streaming the Premier League match between Tottenham and Liverpool is no walk in the park, especially with the recent setback against Nottingham Forest last season. Despite their dismal performance this time around, Thomas Frank's side will be eager to return to winning ways, and the pressure will be on the visitors to avoid a shock defeat at the hands of Spurs. Here are the key matchup details, followed by expert analysis from Sam Tabuteau, who is at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Injury update: The Liverpool squad is missing the services of their top scorer, Dominik Szoboszlai, as he sustained an ankle injury in the win over Brighton. This may give Tottenham a chance to play with a more attack-minded lineup, and we can expect to see attacking midfielder Bruno Guimaraes take up the attacker's role left vacant by the injured Szoboszlai. Liverpool's defense is also in need of rest due to their recent string of impressive performances against lesser opponents.

Teams: Tottenham Hotspur XI (4-3-3): Hugo Ekitike, Vincent Lindsey-Kitchen, Ryan Sessegnon, Danny Rose, Erik Lamela, Tanguy Ndombele, Moussa Sissoko, Dejan Kulusevski, Eric Dier, Kane, Lucas Moura. Subs: Heung-Min Son (GK), Matt Doherty (GK), Davinson Sanchez, Jan Vertonghen, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Tyreli Georgia, Richarlison, Andros Townsend, Giovani Lo Celso, Bruno Guimaraes.

Liverpool XI (4-3-3): Emiliano Buendia, Adama Traore, Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah, Naby Keita, Georginio Wijnaldum, Thiago Alcântara, Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip, Sadio Mané, Trent Alexander-Arnold. Subs: Andrew Robertson (GK), James Milner (GK), Nat Phillips, Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Andy Robertson, Neco Williams, Curtis Jones, Dominic Solanke.

Liverpool's challenges:
- Liverpool have won their last 13 meetings with Tottenham (D6, L7) including the recent match in which they failed to record a single goal (L9), and the visitors are on a four-game losing streak at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
- Tottenham haven't won since November 2019 in this stadium, with their last win being a 3-1 victory over Bournemouth back in August 2018.
- Liverpool have failed to score in four of their past five Premier League home games against Tottenham (W1), which is the joint-longest winning streak by any side in this fixture at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

For Spurs, this match serves as a chance to bounce back from the loss they suffered at the hands of Nottingham Forest last time out. Liverpool's recent form has been impressive, and we can expect a highly charged atmosphere in this fixture. But with Tottenham's attack-minded approach, there could be fireworks on the night.

Live rjpool prediction: The game is likely to end in a 1-0 defeat for Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs have been on a winning streak since October and are capable of getting back to winning ways with an impressive performance against their bitter rivals.</div>
