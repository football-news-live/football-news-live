            <div class="content">In a Sports Journalist's report, Arsenal have learned that Real Madrid has inserted a new releaase clause into Victor Valdepeñas's contract at the Bernabeu. The 19-year-old Spanish midfielder is widely considered one of the shining lights of Real Madrid's academy and has enjoyed a meteoric rise in recent months. However, Valdepeñas's versatility has proved valuable this season as he often operates at both centre-back and left-back for Madrid's reserve side, which has resulted in him playing almost 800 minutes for Alvaro Arrieta's team, fourth in the Primera Federación table. Despite this, Valdepeñas was recently linked to Aston Villa and Arsenal but Madrid seems intent on keeping him at their academy, with a new contract reportedly reaching over €50 million, according to report in Spanish newspaper AS.</div>
