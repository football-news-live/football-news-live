Newcastle v Chelsea - Premier League, live from 12.30pm GMT on Sky Sports. (Update: Match ends 2-2 after extra time!)

Oh my, Sanchez heads the ball on and Thiaw slips, making it one-on-one with Ramsdale! The Chelsea striker is up for it, but he's caught by Thiaw, who slips to slot home into the far corner. We're all square now, just like 65 minutes ago when a pained expression crossed Eddie Howe's face and Gordon was claimed by Sanchez! There's no let-up as Garnacho gets to the byline and crosses towards Fernandez, who takes aim but can't get in front of the Chelsea defender. Thiaw does very well for a volley out, but Germaine's ball is also headed away!

Another "lucy" player suggestion from Nick Smith - Steven Gerrald and Javier Zaanen! Another lucy recommendation from Lucy Perez - Luis Enrique! A couple of utility players in Carlisle and Jimmy Glaser, suggested by Richard Hirst.</div>
