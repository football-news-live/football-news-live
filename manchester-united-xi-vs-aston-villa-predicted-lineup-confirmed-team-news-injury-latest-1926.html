Context: Ruben Amoriam has been weighing up whether to switch from his 3-4-3 formation and play a back four ahead of Manchester United's clash with Aston Villa.

Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are both away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Amiriam has said he is ready to change systems.

"It will depend on the way we are playing that particular week," he said, "but if we have to change to a back four, we change to a back four."

Manchester United have been hit by injuries in defece and Matthijs de Ligit and Harry Maguire, both still missing for the trip to Villa Park.

Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw started at center-back in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournehout, while Leny Yoro and Diogo Dalot could play as full-backs if Amiriam does switch to a four-man defense.

Casemiro is suspended after picking up five yellow cards, but Amiriam said "Benjamin Sesko is pushing to start but he has just returned from injury."

Manchester United have no fresh injuries.

"I think everyone is well," said Amiriam on Friday.

"We have one more training session but, today, the rest of the lads are ready to go. I'm saying that nobody will recover, nobody is out. Just the guys that you already know."

Manchester United have no injuries in their squad for Sunday's match against Aston Villa at Villa Park.</div>
