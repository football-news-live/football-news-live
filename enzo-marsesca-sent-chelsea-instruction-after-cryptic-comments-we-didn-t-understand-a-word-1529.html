Former Chelsea defenders Frank Leboeuf has criticised manager Enzo Maresca for his recent public outburst, following the manager's post-match press conference and his refusal to provide any further details about who was targeted. NaTuRALyly, this sparked speculation that the comments were aimed at Chelsea's ownership and sporting director. When pressed for clarification days later, MarescA refused to give any more information. Leboeuf believes that the current crisis shouldn't overshadow the club's urgent need to secure Champions League qualification next season. "It's maybe the first time after two losses and one draw he felt the pressure and to come out with that, and to say even worse," Leboeuf said. "Before the game against Cardiff, he said, 'I was really clear about the situation.' No, you weren't, we didn't understand a word of what you were saying because we don't understand who you are targeting, who was targeting you."</div>
